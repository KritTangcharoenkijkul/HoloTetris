# HoloTetris
Prototype Hololive Tetris Game (Abandoned)

# Expectation

Initially, I planned to make a hololive tetris game as a learning experience. I have seen many example of Hololive fan-made game being made well such as HoloCure and Holotyping.

However, my mind shift to other project that make me more thrilling and willing to work hard for. However, for anyone who would like to play it or continue this project or even make a project on their own. 
Feel free Hololive is forever.

Future Vision:
Hololive tetris was supposed to be Tetris games with special skill where characters have unique abilities to clear the line on their own. Clear lines to collect point.
The point can be use to unlock more character and skills.

Control:

Tetris game using Z as A button and X as B button. 
P button is ultimate skill that will clear two lines from the bottom.
